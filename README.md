# VBA-challenge
Module 2 for UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp

I worked with Andrea Paredes, Ronald Alfelor, and Edmond Magpantay. Ronald 
showed me how to format the code as a percent with 2 decimal places - 
specifically ".NumberFormat="#.##%"" 
Andrea and Ed showed me how to calculate the running total for the volume 
(I originally had it in the 'else' part of the if statement and it was 
calculating incorrectly). Lastly, I used the internet to figure out how to 
format as scientific notation.
